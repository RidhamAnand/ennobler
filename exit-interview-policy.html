      <h1>Ennobler Private Limited, Exit Interview Policies</h1>
      <h5>At Ennobler Private Limited, we understand the value of gathering feedback from departing employees. Our exit
        interview services are designed to provide valuable insights, foster continuous improvement, and enhance the
        overall employee experience. To ensure a fair and effective process, we have established the following
        policies:</h5>
      <h5>
        <b> Voluntary Participation:</b>
        Participation in exit interviews is completely voluntary. Employees are under no obligation to take part in
        the process and can choose to decline or opt-out without any negative consequences. We respect each
        individual's decision regarding their participation. <br> <br>

        <b> Confidentiality and Anonymity:</b>
        We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of all exit interview discussions. Any information shared
        during the interview will be treated as strictly confidential. If employees prefer to remain anonymous, we
        will respect their choice and take appropriate measures to ensure their identity remains protected. <br>
        <br>

        <b> Purpose and Objectives:</b>
        The primary purpose of our exit interview services is to gather feedback from departing employees to gain
        valuable insights into their experiences, perceptions, and suggestions. This information enables us to
        identify areas for improvement within our organization, enhance employee engagement, and strengthen retention
        strategies. <br> <br>

        <b>Interview Process:</b>
        Exit interviews can be conducted through online channels, including virtual meetings. <br> <br>

        <b> Professional and Respectful Approach:</b>
        Our interviewers are trained to conduct exit interviews in a professional, empathetic, and respectful manner.
        They will actively listen, ask relevant questions, and create a safe space for departing employees to express
        their opinions and experiences without fear of reprisal. <br> <br>

        <b> Feedback Utilization:</b>
        The feedback received from exit interviews will be analyzed and used for continuous improvement initiatives
        within the organization. It will be treated as valuable input for assessing organizational culture, employee
        satisfaction, and identifying areas where enhancements can be made to better support our employees. <br> <br>

        <b> Continuous Learning and Action:</b>
        We are committed to using the insights gained from exit interviews to drive positive change. Feedback received
        will be carefully reviewed, and appropriate action plans will be developed to address any identified issues or
        areas of improvement. We value the feedback provided by departing employees and consider it an integral part
        of our commitment to continuous learning and growth. <br><br>

        <b>Payment and Refund Policy:

        </b>
        Ennobler Private Limited specifies its accepted payment methods and the terms of payment in the service
        agreement.
        Clients are responsible for making timely payments as agreed upon in the service agreement.
        In case of cancellations or rescheduling, clients are required to provide a minimum notice period as outlined in
        the service agreement.
        Refund policies, if applicable, will be clearly communicated in the service agreement. <br> <br>

        <b> Scheduling and Rescheduling:

        </b>
        Clients can schedule  sessions through our online booking system or by contacting Ennobler Private
        Limited directly.
        To ensure a smooth process, clients are encouraged to schedule sessions in advance.
        Any requests for rescheduling or cancellations should be made within the agreed-upon notice period, as specified
        in the service agreement<br> <br>

        <b> Communication Policy:

        </b>
        Ennobler Private Limited maintains open and transparent communication channels with our clients.
        Clients can reach us via email or phone during specified working hours.
        We strive to respond to client communication in a timely manner, taking into account the nature and urgency of
        the inquiry. <br> <br>
        <b> Service Agreement:

        </b>
        Our  services are provided based on a mutually agreed-upon service agreement between Ennobler Private
        Limited and the client.
        The service agreement outlines the scope of work,  objectives, session duration, and the agreed-upon
        fees for the  services.
        The responsibilities and expectations of both the client and the coach are clearly defined in the service
        agreement to establish a productive  relationship.<br>
        <br>


        By adhering to these policies, we aim to create an exit interview process that benefits both our organization
        and our employees. We appreciate the time and effort that departing employees invest in providing their
        feedback, and we strive to make their exit experience as positive and constructive as possible. <br>

        Please note that these policies are subject to change, and any updates will be communicated through our
        website or other appropriate channels.
